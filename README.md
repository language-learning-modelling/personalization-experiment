# overview
This repository implements a pipeline for personalizaing Language Models for a specific languager learner benefiting from the learner own writing, similar writings based on nationality and language proficiency level 

We mainly want to create a single architecture that has an embedding representation of the learner 





# random ideas
- can we create tokens representing the temporal differences from when a text was written until the actual text being predicted by a learner ?
